#EE

## PRELIVE
- integrate w/ kffp git repo
- finish prototype
	- hallway usability testing
	- get feedback from stakeholders
	- quick demo vid
- Persistence layer ( aka Future Project Sprout )
- tests for boundaries
	- search api down
	- F.P.Sprout I/0
	- state -> component render
	- component event handling (?)
	- reducer testing (state + action) => state
- um... deploy stuff?
	- soivers
	- automate 'em

## SHORT
come up with more confusing service names

- Bigger thing here: [audience engine](http://www.audienceengine.net/)
	- only problem: not much info about the project
	- [wfmu github](https://github.com/wfmu)
	- seems like the only code they've put out is an ember select and php
		utils
	- prob needs a call/email from a stakeholder and some sort of
		technical braindump from AE person (???)

### e.g.
- pollard
- sprout
- spector
- aphex
- marr

## LONG
- dunno?
- more cricklike
